=======

The Dumb User Dynamic Emulator (DUDE) is a python script aimed at micmicking dumb user activities such as: clicking links on web pages; clicking links on emails; etc... The DUDE was primarily created to be utilized in Infosec CTFs to allow users to practice phishing users to enter the next level of a competition. This same code base can also be utilized to click random links in craigslist, open up attachments and click on links set to gmail, ymail, hotmail, etc... to increase the capabilities of pro-active honeypots.
